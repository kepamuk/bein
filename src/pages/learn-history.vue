              In 2020, our community of crypto enthusiasts started working on
              the idea of a new stablecoin.

              Fascinated by XRP, they set out to create a new coin that would be
              a better and improved version of pre-existing stablecoins. The
              goal was to create a digital asset that was faster, cheaper and
              built specifically for payments.

              The BIXRP first launched in June 2021 and will have 500 billion
              coins available in total.

                  The history of the BIXRP starts in mid 2020 when the Be in
                  community realized the opportunity in creating a stablecoin as
                  well as a wallet that wouldn't just help people easily make
                  exchanges with other coins and store those in the wallet. This
                  would become a system of products where BIXRP and Be in wallet
                  would work together in unison to help the users earn an income
                  much faster with little or no effort.

                  The next move was to bring the idea to life. The process
                  required long hours and compelling discussions with the top
                  industry experts. Before starting everything we had to analyze
                  every other existing coin that had some value in it, trying to
                  figure out their strengths and weaknesses to use the know-how
                  when building our own stablecoin.
